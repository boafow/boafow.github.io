    <p>I started my journey through the computer science field at a relatively young age. The very first thing I interacted with through a PC was a computer game. Throughout my early childhood, computer games provided me with some of my most fond memories. It was a way for my dad, sister, and I to bond. We would take turns making futile attempts to clear levels on this SouthPark Mario game. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics">Years</a> passed and when I entered middle school, I got my first laptop. It was a humble Chromebook. There wasnâ€™t much I could do on it in terms of gaming, but I found a way. I would play browser games, and this led me to a game that did nothing short of change my life. </p>
    <p>Enter, Realm of the Mad God. Realm of the Mad God (RotMG) is a bullet-hell, massive multiplayer online role playing game. It has 8-bit graphics and involves permadeath, which surprisingly made the game more attractive. As I quickly immersed myself in Realm, I began to question how such a game came about, would it be possible to figure out how some, or maybe all of its components come together to provide such a fun experience? I had to find out, and so, I looked up ways to look at the RotMG source code. This led me to private servers for RotMG, where an older version of the game would run off of a local server. I downloaded the source code and got to work. Through watching YouTube videos and downloading various software such as Microsoft Visual Studio, I successfully set up private server. In this server, I was omnipotent, I looked through the source code for commands and values that I could take advantage of with my newfound privileges. This experience led me to make the conclusion, while in middle school, that I wanted to pursue a career in the computer science field.</p>
